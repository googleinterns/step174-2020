## Overview
Backstory is a full-stack web application created for the capstone project segment of the 2020 virtual Google STEP internship.

Backstory allows the user to upload any picture or series of pictures, analyzes them, and auto-generates a short story (about one paragraph) matching the tone, objects, and setting of the picture.

The primary goal of the project is to be entertaining and personal. The user should be able to connect with themselves and others while having fun.

## Project Design
To achieve the primary objectives of entertainment and personalization, Backstory will return a high quality body of text with some relation to an image, or series of images, uploaded by the user, within a timely manner.
